//Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.

        if (arr[mid] >= x) {
            result = mid;   
            high = mid - 1; 
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;  
        }

    scanf("%d", &x);
